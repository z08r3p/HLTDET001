Mixing instructions
•          Mix 40ml   of water   per   100g   of   Gypsum   Plaster   X   powder   in   a   clean   bowl
•          Stir the   mixture   using the   provided spatula for   15-20   seconds to   combine the   materials
•          Using a   rapid   mixing   action,   stir   the   mixture for   an   additional   20-25   seconds   to   ensure   a   consistent   mix
•            Inspect the   mixture for any air   bubbles
•          Flatten   any   air   bubbles   using the   provided   spatula
•          Inspect the   mixture   before   pouring to   ensure the   mixture   is   consistent   and   appears   thick   and   creamy
•          Place the   bowl containing   the   mix   on   a   vibrator   and   run   the   vibrator   for   at   least   30   seconds
Pouring instructions
First Stage   Pour:
•          Place the   impression on the   vibrator. Then,   starting   at   one   corner,   deliver   a   small   amount   of   the   plaster   into the   molar tooth   impression, allowing   it to flow   into the   impression.
•          Repeat this step   until   all the   tooth   impressions   are   filled.   The   plaster   should   flow   around   the   arch   of   the   impression, completely   filling   one   toothat   a   time.
•          Carefully check for   bubbles. The vibrator   should   eliminate   these;   however,   if   a   bubble   appears   and does   not go away with vibration,   pop   it with   a   small   ins代 写HLTDET001 Construct modelsC/C++

•          Allow the   mix   in the   impression to   reach the ‘initial set’   .   This   usually   occurs   between   9-11   minutes and will   be several   minutes after the   plaster   loses   its glossy   appearance.
Second Stage   Pour:
•          When the tooth depressions   have filled,   add   plaster   in   larger   amounts to   a   level   slightly   above   the   impression walls. Continue to vibrate to   ensure complete   coverage.
•          Blend the   pours together with   the   spatula   to   create   a   continuous   connection.   While   holding      the   handle of the   impression tray,   use the spatula to shape the   sides   of the   model   material            around the first   pour. Avoid   placing the wet   material from the   base onto   the   impression tray   because this would create a   mechanical   lock that   is difficult to   separate   when   set.
•          Place the   remaining   model   material onto   a   tile,   forming   a   mound   slightly   wider than   the   impression
•          Add the   base to the top of the filled   impression   by   inverting the   impression   onto   the   base
•          The final setting time   is   between 45-60   minutes from   the   start   of the   second   pour
